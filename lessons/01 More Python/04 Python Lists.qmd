## A review of the Python list   

Although you should be familiar with Python lists, they are quite important and used often; therefore, we   
will go over it again.  Generally, a Python  sequence  is composed of (typically related) elements.  Each    
element in a sequence is assigned an index (or position).  A sequence with  **n**  elements has indexes 0 to    
**n** â€“1.  Python has many built-in types of sequences; however, the most popular is called the list.   
The  list  in Python is quite versatile.  Recall that a list is declared using square brackets; for example:   
grades  =  [  94 ,  78 ,  100 ,  86  ]   
The statement above declares the list  grades  with four integers: 94, 78, 100, and 86.  The list can be    
displayed in its entirety (e.g., with the statement  print(grades) ); however, we can access each    
element individually by its index (specified within brackets).  Accessing can mean to read a value in the    
list, or it can mean to change a value in the list; for example:   
print( grades[ 0 ])   
grades[ 3 ]  =   87   
8   


grades[ 1 ]  +=   2   
Recall that more than one value in a list can be accessed at a time.  We can specify a range (or interval)    
of indexes in the format  [lower:upper+1]  which means the interval [lower, upper) (i.e., closed at    
lower and open at upper).  That is, the lower index in the range is inclusive but the upper is not.  For    
example: 

```Python
stuff[3:4]  # accesses index 3 (the same as stuff[3])   
stuff[0:5]  # accesses indexes 0 through 4   
stuff[-3]   # accesses the third index  from the right   
```
Also recall that list elements can be deleted with the  del  keyword as follows:   
del   stuff[ 2 ]   
Finally, recall that Python provides several built-in operations that can be performed on lists.  Here are    
many of them:   
len(list)   
Returns the length of a list   
max(list)   
Returns the item in the list with the maximum value   
min(list)   
Returns the item in the list with the minimum value   
list.append(item)   
Inserts item at the end of the list   
list.count(item)   
Returns the number of times an item appears in the list   
list.index(item)   
Returns the index of the first occurrence of item   
list.insert(index, item)  Inserts an item at the specified index in the list   
list.remove(item)   
Removes the first occurrence of item from the list   
list.reverse()   
Reverses the items in the list   
list.sort()   
Sorts a list
